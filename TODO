- Modify nullmailer-send to always run through its entire queue before
  stopping.

*** Add a delayed delivery notification system somehow ***

- For version 2: three-state queueing
  - Queue message partially (tmp -> holding)
  - Send to recipient immediately
  - Remove from holding if sending succeeds
  - Complete queueing (holding -> queue) if sending fails
