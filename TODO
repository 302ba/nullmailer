- Add a "me" config file from which the hostname is derived.

- Add note to HOWTO about setting hostnames.

- Modify nullmailer-send to always run through its entire queue before
  stopping.

*** Add a delayed delivery notification system somehow ***

- For version 1.1: improved protocol module API
  - Need to communicate better error messages to nullmailer-send.

- For version 2: three-state queueing
  - Queue message partially (tmp -> holding)
  - Send to recipient immediately
  - Remove from holding if sending succeeds
  - Complete queueing (holding -> queue) if sending is deferred
  - Return with an error if sending fails (permanently)
  - Move all from holding -> queue on startup of nullmailer-send
